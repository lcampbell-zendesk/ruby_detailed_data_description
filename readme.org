# Search - Detailed Data Scription

This implementation attempts to capture all of the requirements as data. The
hope is that this will allow all functionality to be written generically, and
using minimal code.

* Todo

- [X] Prompt the user for search terms
- [X] Print the results
- [ ] Automatically index ~id~ and ~reference~ fields.
- [ ] Include related results
- [ ] Search for individual tags
- [ ] Allow OR based search
- [ ] Refactor and add tests

* Features

- Validation of types stored as strings (Date, Enum, URL, UUID)
- Parsing of Dates, meaning timezone aware search will work
- JSON input that allows for explicit types
- Select widget for all limited option choices (menus, enums, booleans). This means responses aren't free form, the select widget will continue to prompt you until you enter a valid choice. Only then will it allow the program to
  progress.
- Explicit id and reference types that are emmenable to indexing
- Explicit optional fields
